Parse a mime tree, no magic included. This is supposed to be a "low level" mime parsing module. No magic is performed on the data (eg. no joining HTML parts etc.). All body data is emitted out as Typed Arrays, so no need to perform any base64 or quoted printable decoding by yourself. Text parts are decoded to UTF-8 if needed.

## Usage

```
npm install --save emailjs-mime-parser
```

```javascript
import parse from 'emailjs-mime-parse'

parse(String) -> MimeNode
```

### MimeNode

A MimeNode represents a MIME tree.

```
MimeNode
|
+----> childNodes -> [MimeNode]
+----> content -> Uint8Array
+----> bodyStructure -> String
```

```
MimeNode.childNodes -> [MimeNode]
```

The child MIME nodes are stored in the `childNodes` array.

```
MimeNode.content -> Uint8Array
```

The content of the specific node is stored in `this.content` as Uint8Array. All body data is emitted as Typed Arrays, so no need to perform any base64 or quoted printable decoding by yourself. Text parts are decoded to UTF-8 if needed.

**message/rfc822** is automatically parsed if the mime part does not have a `Content-Disposition: attachment` header, otherwise it will be emitted as a regular attachment (as one long Uint8Array value).


```
MimeNode.bodyStructure -> String
```

Bodystructure is the original raw message stripped of bodies and multipart preambles. MIME stores like to store the bodystructure of MIME content in raw (loss-less) form, to later run through a MIME parser to answer IMAP or WebDAV type queries.
